                Hello, my name is <b>Daniel Sinaga</b>.
                I want to tell you about my 4-month vacation and I applied for a job at the dormitory. Thank God I was accepted to work
                at the dormitory. I am grateful because God still gave me a job at the dormitory, because I didn't go home so I still
                work at the dormitory, I work cleaning rooms, brushing, wiping tables, painting walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I also helped the female dormitory workers on vacation because Mem asked for help from the male dormitory because
                there was an event. They were running out of time, so Ser gave permission to help the female dormitory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also helped Daining's children because there was a distnatalis. Mem asked me for help because she needed
                workers to wash dishes, so I helped as a dishwasher in these 4 months. It was tiring, but praise God, He still gave me the spirit and a strong
                body so that I could be strong in 4 months of work and given smoothness in these 4 months. I am very grateful to God.
                That's my story on this 4-month vacation. May God bless you.
            </p>
